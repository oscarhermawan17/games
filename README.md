## Games Overview
This repository contains two simple games: a Matching Card game and a Sudoku game. These games were developed using modern web technologies, including Vite, React, TypeScript, and Material UI.

### 1. Matching Card Game
The Matching Card game is a classic memory game where the objective is to match pairs of cards. Players are presented with a grid of face-down cards and must flip them over two at a time, trying to find matching pairs. The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.

### 2. Sudoku Game
The Sudoku game is a classic puzzle where the objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. 

## Technologies Used
This project was built using the following technologies:

Vite: A fast build tool that serves as a replacement for Webpack. It significantly improves the development experience with its lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR).

React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications where a responsive and interactive experience is required.

TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types, enabling better code quality and easier debugging.

Material UI: A React component library that implements Google's Material Design. It was used for styling the user interface, providing a clean and consistent look and feel.
